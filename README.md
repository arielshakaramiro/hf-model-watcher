# HF Model Watcher

A daily, self-updating catalog of new models on the Hugging Face Hub, in three categories:

- **Vision**: image classification, detection, segmentation, depth, vision-language models
- **Speech**: speech recognition, text-to-speech, audio models
- **LLM Indonesia**: every new language model tagged with Indonesian (`id`)

Every morning a GitHub Actions workflow queries the Hub, filters out noise, adds newly found models to a CSV catalog, writes a short daily report, and refreshes the section below.

## Recent additions

<!-- WATCHER_START -->
_The first update will appear here after the workflow runs._
<!-- WATCHER_END -->

## How it works

```
Hugging Face Hub API ──► per-category query ──► noise filter ──► catalog/*.csv + reports/ + README
```

1. **Query.** Vision and Speech are fetched per task (e.g. `object-detection`, `automatic-speech-recognition`), sorted by trending score. LLM Indonesia is fetched by the language tag `id`, sorted by creation date.
2. **Filter.** A model is kept only if it was created in the last 30 days and its name doesn't look like a throwaway upload (`test`, `demo`, `checkpoint-500`, `tugas`, ...). Vision and Speech also require early traction (at least 3 likes or 500 downloads), because hundreds of experimental fine-tunes are uploaded every day. LLM Indonesia keeps everything, since the language is small enough to track in full.
3. **Catalog.** New models are appended with the date they were first seen. Likes and downloads are refreshed while a model stays in the feed.
4. **Report.** `reports/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md` lists that day's additions, sorted by likes.

If nothing new passes the filters, no file changes and no commit is made.

## Catalog format

`catalog/vision.csv`, `catalog/speech.csv`, `catalog/llm-indonesia.csv`:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `model_id` | Hub repo id, e.g. `org/model-name` |
| `author` | Organization or user |
| `task` | Pipeline tag (`gguf` for GGUF uploads without one) |
| `library` | `transformers`, `gguf`, `peft`, ... |
| `params_b` | Parameter count in billions (when the repo has safetensors metadata) |
| `license` | From the repo's license tag |
| `base_model` | The model it was fine-tuned or quantized from, if declared |
| `languages` | Language tags on the repo |
| `created_at` / `first_seen` | Repo creation date / date this watcher caught it |
| `likes` / `downloads` | Popularity at last refresh |

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arielshakaramiro/hf-model-watcher/main/catalog/llm-indonesia.csv")
df.sort_values("likes", ascending=False).head(20)
```

## Setup

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Optional: add a Hugging Face read token as the secret `HF_TOKEN` (**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**) for higher API rate limits. It works without one.
3. **Actions → Daily Model Watch → Run workflow** to trigger the first run.

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python watcher.py
```

## Customize

Everything lives in `config.json`:

- Add a category by adding an entry under `categories`. For a language category set `language` (e.g. `"ms"` for Malay, `"jv"` for Javanese); otherwise list `pipeline_tags`.
- `min_likes` / `min_downloads`: the traction filter (a model passes if it meets either). Set both to `0` to keep everything.
- `max_age_days`: how recent a model must be.
- `exclude_name_patterns`: regular expressions for names to skip.

## License

MIT. Model metadata comes from the public [Hugging Face Hub API](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub); each model keeps its own license.
